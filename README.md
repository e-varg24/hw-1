# Challange week 1

## Discription

This weeks challange was about semantic HTML. We learned how to organize them all and start from a basic code and clean it all up and learn how to lable and re organize things so it was easy to read in a flowing matter. it took lots of research and time to figuer out but it was worth it becuse i learned the base order of creating a readable html. The Html was not only easy for me to read but as well for others to come in and understand it.
